# lxqt-themes-mint-y

This repository houses 2 LXQt themes, Mint-Y and Mint-Y-Dark, as well as a large collection of palettes for them. In order to save space and not clutter up the theme selector, I have created _only_ these two themes, and instructed them to pull colors from the user-selected palette. In this way, it is also possible for the user to create a custom Mint-Y-like theme by simply changing their active palette; things such as text colors have been hardcoded to enture sanity, however.
